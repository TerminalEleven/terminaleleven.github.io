		<h1>SkyView Privacy Policy</h1>
		<p>
		This policy applies to all information collected or submitted on Terminal Eleven LLC’s (“us”, “we”, “our”) website and our mobile apps: “SkyView&reg; Explore the Universe”, “SkyView&reg; Satellite Guide”, and “SkyView&reg; Satellite Guide Free” (“apps”). By using our website or apps, you consent to our privacy policy.

		<h2>Information we Collect</h2>
		<p>
		We take personal privacy seriously and do not collect or store any of your personal data.

		<h2>Retention and deletion of information</h2>
		<p>
		Since we do not collect personal data, we do not provide a means to delete it because it does not exist.
		</p>

		<h2>Location Data</h2>
		<p>
		When our apps are in use (or running in the background) we use your location data to calculate the positions of various celestial objects near you. These calculations occur on your device and we do not transmit your location data anywhere.

		<h2>Analytics</h2>

		We use <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/allowing-users-to-manage-data/">App Store Connect</a>, <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9934569">Google Play</a>, and <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy">Google Firebase</a> to help us improve the app. Each service provides us with anonymized usage data that we use to inform development decisions and understand how people are using our apps.
		</p>

		<h2>Information we disclose to third parties</h2>
		<p>
		We do not disclose your information to third parties.
		</p>

		<h2>GDPR</h2>

		Our services may contain links to other sites that are not operated by us. If you click a third party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit.  We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party sites or services.
