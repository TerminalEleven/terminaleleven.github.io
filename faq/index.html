    <h2>Why is the view pointing in the wrong direction?</h2>
    <p>Follow these steps to improve the accuracy of your view:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Remove any case from your device that may cause interference. Cases that contain magnets will cause the view to point in the wrong direction.</li>
      <li>Calibrate the digital compass in your device: hold the phone in front of you and swing the device in a figure 8 motion for about 30 seconds.</li>
    </ul>
    <br/>
    <h2>Why is the view still a little off even after I reset the compass?</h2>
    <p>For being so small, the digital compass inside your device is very accurate; however, it is not perfect. Even small magnetic fields in your immediate area can cause the view to be off slightly. If the view isnâ€™t perfect, trying using SkyView in a different area.</p>
